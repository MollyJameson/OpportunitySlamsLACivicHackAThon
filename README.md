Opportunity Slams ( LA Civic Hack-a-thon project )
============

A game project with an interesting way of viewing census data relative to different LA areas aiming to educate.

A very short project coded for [LA Civic Hack-a-thon](http://hackforchange.org/hack-la) with [DcCoulombe](https://github.com/DcCoulombe)

Submission Description
-----------------
Using data from the US Census we have built a side-scrolling Flash game where the user controls an avatar that must pick-up random drops and avoid obstacles for as long as they can. The goals of this project are to give users a way to interact with statistical data provided by the Census in a fun way, as well as illustrate the social and economic stratification of Los Angeles. The frequency of drops and obstacles reflects economic conditions and trends in education and job attainment in LA neighborhoods. At the end, the user is presented with some relevant statistics used to build the level for their neighborhood, and encouraged to play again or explore another neighborhood.
